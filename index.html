            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome! This page is meant to help recruiters and hiring managers see a little bit about who I am and to better showcase some of the projects I am most proud of. With each of these projects, I will include some disscussion about them but I welcome any questions.</p>

        <div class="section" id="section2">
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>This section will showcase some of the projects I've worked on. From personal projects to professional work, each project demonstrates my skills and experience. Links to these projects are provided where possible.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/MichaelCochran/rabbit_breeding">Rabbit Breeding</a></h3>
            <p>This is a project that was initially meant to help me track the breeding production of the rabbits I had on my homestead. Originally this was then end of the functionality planned other than adding a GUI to make it more user friendly.</p>
            <p>This project is now in a stage of redesign so that I can add functionaliy for other animals. Plans include adding support for cows, pigs, horses, and goats. The GUI is still planned but has to have a redesign as well due to the added functionality.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/MichaelCochran/Password-Strength">Password Strength</a></h3>
            <p>This rather simplistic script takes user input and gives a bit strength of the password provided. This is one of those projects that is an exercise in futility. There is no practical use for this project it its current state but might be useful if added to another program to ensure useres select passwords of a minimum strength.</p>
