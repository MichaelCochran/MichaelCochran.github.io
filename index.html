            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>I'm a passionate software developer with a strong foundation in software development, honed through academic and professional experiences. I graduated from Brigham Young University Idaho in 2023 with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and have since been dedicated to advancing my skills and contributing to impactful projects.</p>

            <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
            <p>Since October 2023, I have been working as a Software Test Engineer, focusing on modeling software used by government contractors to help ensure national security. This role has allowed me to engage deeply with various aspects of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and Agile methodologies. My work supports defense contracting, a field I am deeply committed to due to its vital role in national safety and well-being.</p>

            <p>In addition to my full-time role, I am also developing a personal software project aimed at helping individuals better manage their finances. This project reflects my interest in creating practical, user-friendly solutions that address real-world challenges.</p>

            <h2>Personal Projects and Learning</h2>
            <p>I am constantly seeking to improve my skills through self-study and online courses from platforms like Codecademy and DataCamp. I believe in lifelong learning and am currently looking at which Masters program will best add to my skills and experience.</p>

            <h2>Passion for Writing</h2>
            <p>Recognizing the value of sharing knowledge, I have initiated "Write It Wednesdays," a personal commitment to blog about my learning experiences. These blog posts will document my journey through projects, courses, and readings, providing insights and takeaways for fellow developers.</p>

            <h2>Values and Aspirations</h2>
            <p>My career is driven by a desire to contribute to the defense sector, inspired by the veterans in my family who instilled in me a strong sense of duty and service. Looking ahead, I aspire to possibly start my own business in the defense industry, providing innovative solutions and services.</p>
            <p>In my daily routine, I prioritize personal growth and balance, dedicating time to study and family responsibilities. These practices ground me and fuel my dedication to my professional and personal endeavors.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>This section will showcase some of the projects I've worked on. From personal projects to professional work, each project demonstrates my skills and experience. Links to these projects are provided where possible.</p>
            
            <h3>Current Employment</h3>
            <p>In my current role, I contribute to ITASE, a modeling and simulation software developed under government contract to support scenario simulation and analysis. While the work is unclassified, it intersects with classified materials, and details are limited to maintain operational security.</p>
            <p>My responsibilities include ensuring the quality of the project by collaborating across two distinct teams and facilitating coordination between them. Additionally, I am involved in developing and refining strategies and workflows to optimize quality assurance procedures, ensuring the software meets the highest standards of reliability and performance.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/MichaelCochran/rabbit_breeding">Rabbit Breeding</a></h3>
            <p>This is a project that was initially meant to help me track the breeding production of the rabbits I had on my homestead. Originally this was then end of the functionality planned other than adding a GUI to make it more user friendly.</p>
            <p>This project is now in a stage of redesign so that I can add functionaliy for other animals. Plans include adding support for cows, pigs, horses, and goats. The GUI is still planned but has to have a redesign as well due to the added functionality.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/MichaelCochran/Password-Strength">Password Strength</a></h3>
            <p>This rather simplistic script takes user input and gives a bit strength of the password provided. This is one of those projects that is an exercise in futility. There is no practical use for this project it its current state but might be useful if added to another program to ensure useres select passwords of a minimum strength.</p>
            
            <h3>NutriFacts</h3>
            <p>NutriFacts was inspired by my wife’s and my commitment to living a healthier lifestyle. As we worked to improve our nutrition, we noticed gaps in our diet and wanted a practical way to track the nutrients in our meals. This motivation led to the development of NutriFacts as my senior project during my bachelor's degree program.</p>
            <p>The application allows users to input recipe ingredients along with their quantities. It then queries a publicly available  <a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/">database</a> to calculate the nutritional content of each ingredient. The program aggregates this information and presents it in a clear, user-friendly format resembling a standard nutrition facts label—hence the name, NutriFacts. </p>
            <p>This project is slated for redevelopment, incorporating improvements identified during the initial version’s development. While no code is currently available for this project, a link will be provided once the updated version is completed.</p>
