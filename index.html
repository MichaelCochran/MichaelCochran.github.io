            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! This page is designed to provide recruiters and hiring managers with insights into who I am and to highlight some of the projects I am most proud of. Each project includes a brief discussion, and I am more than happy to answer any questions you may have. Additionally, I have outlined several key skills below to foster potential discussions or collaboration opportunities.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>This section will showcase some of the projects I've worked on. From personal projects to professional work, each project demonstrates my skills and experience. Links to these projects are provided where possible.</p>
            
            <h3>Current Employment</h3>
            <p>In my current role, I contribute to ITASE, a modeling and simulation software developed under government contract to support scenario simulation and analysis. While the work is unclassified, it intersects with classified materials, and details are limited to maintain operational security.</p>
            <p>My responsibilities include ensuring the quality of the project by collaborating across two distinct teams and facilitating coordination between them. Additionally, I am involved in developing and refining strategies and workflows to optimize quality assurance procedures, ensuring the software meets the highest standards of reliability and performance.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/MichaelCochran/rabbit_breeding">Rabbit Breeding</a></h3>
            <p>This is a project that was initially meant to help me track the breeding production of the rabbits I had on my homestead. Originally this was then end of the functionality planned other than adding a GUI to make it more user friendly.</p>
            <p>This project is now in a stage of redesign so that I can add functionaliy for other animals. Plans include adding support for cows, pigs, horses, and goats. The GUI is still planned but has to have a redesign as well due to the added functionality.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/MichaelCochran/Password-Strength">Password Strength</a></h3>
            <p>This rather simplistic script takes user input and gives a bit strength of the password provided. This is one of those projects that is an exercise in futility. There is no practical use for this project it its current state but might be useful if added to another program to ensure useres select passwords of a minimum strength.</p>
            
            <h3>NutriFacts</h3>
            <p>NutriFacts was inspired by my wife’s and my commitment to living a healthier lifestyle. As we worked to improve our nutrition, we noticed gaps in our diet and wanted a practical way to track the nutrients in our meals. This motivation led to the development of NutriFacts as my senior project during my bachelor's degree program.</p>
            <p>The application allows users to input recipe ingredients along with their quantities. It then queries a publicly available  <a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/">database</a> to calculate the nutritional content of each ingredient. The program aggregates this information and presents it in a clear, user-friendly format resembling a standard nutrition facts label—hence the name, NutriFacts. </p>
            <p>This project is slated for redevelopment, incorporating improvements identified during the initial version’s development. While no code is currently available for this project, a link will be provided once the updated version is completed.</p>
